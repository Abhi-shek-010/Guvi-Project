## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Chat Application

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java/com/chatapp/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/main/resources/`: Contains the JSON file for bot responses.
- `lib/`: Contains required JAR files.

## Libraries Required
- Gson (for JSON parsing)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have JDK installed.
2. Add the required JAR files to your project.
3. Compile and run `ChatUI.java`.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a server for real-time chat.
- Implement user accounts and password features.
